## Cycle 1 — Foundation & branded login (2026-05-15)

Stood up the deployable Next.js app and shipped the Wenger-branded login screen to Vercel. UI only — no auth, database, or AI yet.

**Added**
- Next.js scaffold via `create-next-app`: Next.js 16.2.6, React 19.2.4, TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS v4 (4.3.0), ESLint, `src/` dir, App Router, Turbopack
- Wenger brand palette as Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens in `globals.css` (`brand-navy` `#0A3758`, `-dark` `#082a45`, `-light` `#1a5685`, `-warm` `#b8612a`, `-warm-soft` `#f5ebe0`), plus a `fade-in` keyframe and a Georgia display font token
- Login page (`src/app/page.tsx`): full-bleed `#082a45→#1a5685` gradient, centered white Wenger logo (~80px), Georgia italic "Field Notes" wordmark, "Pick your name to begin" subtitle, 6 glassmorphism rep buttons (Brooke, Jackie, Rahki, Chad, Tam, Linda), ≥44px touch targets, mount fade-in; rep selection routes to `/placeholder?rep=NAME`
- Placeholder page (`src/app/placeholder/`): server page with a `<Suspense>`-wrapped client component reading `useSearchParams` (required by Next 16 to avoid a CSR bailout on the prerendered route); shows "Hi, {rep}" + a "Cycle 2 will build the app shell here" note + "Back to login"
- `AGENTS.md` — Next.js scaffold guidance file (kept as-is)

**Changed**
- Logos relocated from repo root to `/public/` via `git mv` (history preserved): `public/logo-white.png`, `public/logo-blue.png` (both 800×450)
- `layout.tsx`: dropped the scaffold's Geist web fonts for the CLAUDE.md-mandated system font stack; set real metadata; removed the OS `prefers-color-scheme` dark flip to keep brand colors fixed
- Generated `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md` scaffold stubs discarded in favor of the existing project docs

**Notes**
- Live URL: https://valkolimark-wenger-field-notes.vercel.app (Vercel auto-deploy from `main`, commit `f7a6e62`, status Ready)
- Stack is Next 16 / React 19; CLAUDE.md mandates "Next.js 15+", so this satisfies it — no stack deviation
- **No dependencies added beyond the `create-next-app` baseline.** Framer Motion was *not* needed (CSS/keyframe transitions suffice)
- Scaffolding detail: project dir was non-empty and "CaliBlitz" is an invalid npm package name (capitals), so the app was scaffolded into a temp dir as `wenger-field-notes` then moved into place; package name is `wenger-field-notes`
- Production behavior: `/placeholder` initial HTML serves the `<Suspense>` fallback; the rep name renders client-side after hydration — by design, not a defect

## Cycle 0 — Project foundation (2026-05-15)

Project scaffolding before any code: established the rules, the cycle plan, and the brand identity.

**Added**
- `CLAUDE.md` — master project instructions with tech stack, brand rules, cycle discipline, and the full cycle plan
- `README.md` — developer setup and cycle workflow reference
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file

**Notes**
- Cycle 1 will create the actual Next.js project and ship the branded login screen to Vercel.
- No code committed yet — this is the planning checkpoint.
